   This language primarily aims at people who want to do easy formated text output or parsing of information from files in the terminal.

* Examples
Fizzbuzz
#+begin_src sh
    $ echo "10 20 30 50 55" > file.txt
    $ ltpl file.txt "--$CF[?:=:\3:0]fizz[p][?:=:\5:0]buzz[p]."

#+end_src

 word count
declaritive approach
#+begin_src sh
    $ echo "this is a test here not to mention that this is great too" > file.txt
    $ ltpl "--$NF[p]."
    13
#+end_src

iterative approach
#+begin_src sh 
    $echo "another test here" > file.txt
    $ltpl file.txt "--i[0]$0!$i[+:$i:1]i[p]."
    3
#+end_src

* Installation
  Comming soon to theatres near you!
* Why The Cryptic Syntax
   ltpl's syntax and grammar is very simple aiming and being simple to use in a terminal enviroment.
   With this consideration taken a APL or Regular expression like syntax was considerd appropriate for a speedy interactive usage that I wanted.
